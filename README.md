# Navigation
This application is just testing out how to create navigations. I got the idea and lot of the helpful code from W3Schools.com. I am simply practicing what I learned on the site. 
## CSS 
Played with creating classes id, using hover, fontfamily, font-size, margin, padding, position, offsets, etcs. 
## HTML
Learned to use class,anchors, calling stylesheets and scripts.
